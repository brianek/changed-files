#How to Contribute

To get started contributing to clean-slate you only need two things:

1. A github account
2. Some free time

You can edit files either directly on github, or locally on your computer. The GitHub method is faster,
 but if you're a seasoned git/GitHub user you may prefer the local method. See the instructions below
 for your preferred method.

##Editing on GitHub

1. Sign in to your GitHub account (or [create one](https://github.com/join))
2. Go to the [Code for DC Clean Slate](https://github.com/codefordc/clean-slate) repository.
3. [Fork the repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
4. In order for GitHub pages to build on your repository, you need to commit one code change on any
 file. Any change will work, so for now try just adding a space to the end of one of the markdown files
 (files whose names end in `.MD`)
5. Now you're all set! To see your changes go to `<yourusername>.github.io/clean-slate` for example: if
 your username is "Crazycodingwombat" then your version of the site will show up at
 `crazycodingwombat.github.io/clean-slate`.
6. When you're happy with your changes and want to contribute them to the main project, just
 [issue a pull request](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
